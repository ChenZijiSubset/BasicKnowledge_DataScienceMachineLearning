# 🌍 Data Science and Machine Learning for Planet Earth - Lectures

## 📚 Course overview and learning outcomes 

Welcome to the <strong style = "color:teal">Data Science and Machine Learning for Planet Earth</strong> module. This module will introduce the concepts central to the data science approach, including working in a computational notebook environment, data preparation and data pipelines, and different types of classical machine learning algorithms for regression, classification and clustering.

This module's learning outcomes are:
1.	Describe the different steps involved in a data science / machine learning project, from initial data exploration to production code. 
2.	Clean and manipulate different types of data and prepare them for machine learning analysis using open source libraries. 
3.	Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem at hand and  optimize the predictions by tuning hyperparameters 
4.	Test the performance of a machine learning pipeline through various performance metrics
